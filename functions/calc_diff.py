"""Module for computing timestamp differences.

This file can also be imported as a module and contains the following
functions:

    * calc_diff - calculate timestamp differences for a given
    pair of pixels. Returns an array of differences.

    """Calculate timestamp differences.

    Calculated and returns timestamp differences for the given pair of pixels
    (indicated by the data_pair - data from a single pair of pixels).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_pair : array-like
        Data from 2 pixels.
    timestamps : int, optional
        Number of timestamps per pixel per acquisition window. The default is
        512.
    range_left : float, optional
        Left limit for the timestamp differences. Values below that are not
        taken into account and the differences are not returned. The default
        is -2.5e3.
    range_right : float, optional
        Right limit for the timestamp differences. Values above that are not
        taken into account and the differences are not returned. The default
        is 2.5e3.

    Returns
    -------
    output : array-like
        An array of timestamp differences for the given pair of pixels.
